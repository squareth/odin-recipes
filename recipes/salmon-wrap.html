        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Moving around a lot, I find that cities often do not share the same restaurants. 
            I lived in Seattle for a few years, and am now in Pensacola, FL. I missed the Samurai 
            Salmon Wrap from World Wrapps.</p>
        <p>This is my effort for re-creating this taste sensation. It's a wrap with a fabulous 
           Japanese-Asian flavor and a blend of textures to savor.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1/3 cup thinly julienned daikon</li>
            <li>1/3 chopped cucumber</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon wasabi paste</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1 cup of cooked white rice</li>
            <li>2/3 cup canned salmon, drained</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Toss together the green onion, daikon radish, and cucumber in a small bowl. In a separate 
                bowl, whisk together the rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, wasabi paste, and ground ginger.</li>
            <li>Lay to two tortillas onto a flat surface. Divide the rice and place in the center of each tortilla.
                 Top each portion of rice with half of the salmon and half of the vegetable mixture. </li>
            <li>Drizzle half of the soy sauce mixture over each portion of vegetables. Sprinkle each with 1 
                teaspoon sesame seeds. Wrap the edges of the tortillas around the filling completely to serve.</li>
        </ol>
